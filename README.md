# Sound2Care

Sound2Care is a project which the goal is to achieve an understanding of person computer interaction.
On the website we made a weaker layout so that we can use accessibility tools to detect errors such as links to the home page, references to other sites, among others, as well as usability testing.

In the usability test we asked 5 users of different ages to use the website without any information on how to use it.

We get feedback from them and most of the feedback was about a lack of information on how to use the site and what it is for.

So this project was to understand the concept of creating an accessible application for the target audience we chose. In short it was a project for UX/UI experience.
